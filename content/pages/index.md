## Open Source

I am the maintainer of

GitHub stars) shell prompt generator.

## Personal Life

I am a proud husband and father of two (one yet to be born). I have had many
hobbies over the years, including:

- Most recently I joined the [Liberty Sailing Club](http://libertysailing.org/)
  because sailing is awesome.
- I started playing cello in 2014 - maybe someday I'll be good enough to put
  some of my music on this site.
- I played flute for many years, including in the Drexel Concert Band.
- Swimming is my sport of choice, although it's been years since I have been
  able to regularly swim.
- Languages have always interested me. I spent several years studying German
  while at Drexel and did two studies abroad in Germany. More recently I have
  been learning Spanish.
- Occasionally I get into running - my biggest accomplishment was running the
  [Broad Street Run](http://www.broadstreetrun.com/).
