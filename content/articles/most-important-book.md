Politics has obviously been heavy on everyone's mind recently. Taxes,
immigration, healthcare, it never ends. In my mind, we are not paying enough
attention to the most important issue out there: the wars in the middle east,
which have caused death and destruction on a massive scale over an absurd
length of time.

is the absolute best resource to learn about the United State's involvement in
Afghanistan and the surrounding area. If you have ever wanted to be more
informed on the motivations on the US entering those wars, the history behind
Osama bin Laden and the attacks on 9/11, or anything that has happened since
then - this is the book for you.

Seriously, I can't recommend this book highly enough. It is time for the us to
stand up and put a stop to these wars. Whether you are a Republic, Democrat, or
anarchist like me, there is one thing that can and should unite us all: ending
these unjust wars.
